# PyBer_Analysis
#Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze and visulize data from a rideshare app and use the matplotlib library
to create charts pie graphs and other useful things to visulaize our data. Continuing off from last 
week we continue to us pandas as a tool to go through large amounts of data and matplotlib as a means of visulaizing it.


#Results
With the ressulats i was able to see the difference between riders in different types of towns. The distint difference
between rural ,urban , and suburban ridership.Also there is a drop off in ridership in january for all three types as the beginging of the 
year the ridership is going up till it peaks around the end of february.

#Summary
From the data we can infer that a lot of business is generated with urban ridership so i would devote alot of resources to making things better
here first before anywhere else. The other products need attention too and you should not abandon them compltely.
I would recommend 24 hour service for urban communities esspecially on the weekend. As far as other communites i would not devote all resources to
them. For the winter months i would focus most of of attention to urban driving as it is the best performer out of all three types in the 
winter months
